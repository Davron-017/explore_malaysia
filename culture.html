                Malaysia has a rich cultural life, much of which revolves around the traditional festivities of its diverse population.
                The major Muslim holidays are Hari Raya Puasa “Holiday of Fasting”, or <a target="_blank" href="Aidilfitri">Aidilfitri</a>  (ʿĪd al-Fiṭr)
               , to celebrate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and Hari Raya Haji (“Holiday of the Pilgrimage”),
                or Aidiladha (ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā), to celebrate the culmination of the season of pilgrimage to Mecca.
                 Buddhists honour the life of the Buddha on Hari Wesak (“Wesak Day”), and Chinese Malaysians celebrate Chinese New Year.
                  Deepavali (Diwali), a Hindu festival of lights spanning several days, is observed by many Indian Malaysians, while Christmas
               is the principal holiday of the Christian community. On most of these holidays, it is customary to host an “open house,” 
               where guests are treated to Malaysian delicacies and hospitality. A holiday that spans all ethnic groups and religions is 
               Hari Kebangsaan (National Day), a celebration of Malaysia’s independence on August 31.
